ðŸ›  First, what does "bits" really mean?
========================================

Simple idea:

A bit is the tiniest piece of data in a computer.

It's either a 0 or a 1 (on or off, like a light switch).

Example:

1 bit â†’ can store just two options (0 or 1).

When we say:

64 bits = 64 tiny 0/1 switches to describe a number.

More bits = we can describe bigger or more detailed numbers.


ðŸ“¦ Small vs Big Example:

Imagine you're using boxes to store numbers:


Number of Boxes (bits)	What you can store

8 bits (1 byte)	Numbers from 0 to 255
16 bits	Numbers from 0 to 65,535
32 bits	Very big numbers (over 4 billion!)
64 bits	ENORMOUS numbers (almost endless for normal life)

ðŸ”¥ Tiny Example for You:
Let's say I use 4 bits (small example):


4 bits can store:
0000 = 0
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
...
1111 = 15
